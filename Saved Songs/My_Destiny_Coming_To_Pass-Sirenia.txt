Listening to My Destiny Coming To Pass by Sirenia
Lyrics by azlyrics


This is my destiny coming to pass
This is my one and only life torn and
Splintered, fallen apart
This is the night that I've been drawn
Towards so many times
This night consumed my light

All I ever wanted was to break free from the night
All I ever wanted was a day of light

This is my legacy, shattered to dust
This was the one and only hope for my
Persistence, wrecked so unjust
This endless strife that I've been broken by
So many times
This strife destroyed my life

The chains are strong
My hands feel weak and numb
Night lingers on
These chains can't be undone
Within these walls of devastation
I'm passing through degeneration
Confined in utter desolation
In vile perpetuation I scream in desperation
