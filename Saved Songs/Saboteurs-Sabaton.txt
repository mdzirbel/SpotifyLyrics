Listening to Saboteurs by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


Dropped down to a world of ice
A platoe of frozen lakes
A Nazi place of doom in their sights
Training camps on Scottish Heights
To commando saboteurs
A mission of their lives lies ahead

[Chorus:]
Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war

Allied time was running short
They would race against the bomb
And hours turned to days, time passed on
As the nature Test their strength
They would fight through night and day
To live amongst the wild, stay alive

Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war

Heroes of the telemark
Carry viking blood in veins
Warriors of the northern land
They live forever more [x2]

Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul!

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war [x2]
