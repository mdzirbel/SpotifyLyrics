Listening to At The End Of The Rainbow by Hammerfall
Lyrics by azlyrics


As long as I remember
We've marched across this land
Oh, oh...
Reached for a new horizon
Pulled by the killing hand
Oh, oh...
All fed up with lies
The time has come
To break these chains and fly
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands
We know the treasure lies
Beyond the pouring rain
Oh, oh...
Our quest will last forever
For you it's all the same
Oh, oh...
No one can deny
Our future's set
To reach above the sky
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands
Let's fly away through the rain
Fly high, to ease the burning pain
Oh, the colours fading out
The light is shining in the night
It's up to you, it's worth the fight
Search before the colours fade
Here we stand bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands
