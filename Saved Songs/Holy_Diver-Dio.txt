Listening to Holy Diver by Dio
Lyrics by azlyrics


Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Got!
Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away
Get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
Yeah!
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel
Say!

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump!
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen
Yeah!

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
No, no!
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Get away
Gotta get away
Get away, yeah

Holy Diver
Sole Survivor
You're the one who's clean

Holy Diver
Holy Diver
There a cat in the blue comin' after for you
Holy Diver

Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright!

Get away, get away, get away
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
