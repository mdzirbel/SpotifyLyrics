Listening to Magic Forest by Amberian Dawn
Lyrics by genius


Just moments before the dawn
It's their time to go
One look and they entered the magic forest
They're left alone

A strange weight surrounded them
It felt like burned ice
All branches like fingers they reach to catch them
Leaving their marks

(Hey you little songbirds!)
(Come here, little songbirds!)
(We see you, little songbirds...)
(And we'll keep you!)

(Hey you little songbirds!)
(Come here, little songbirds!)
(We see you, little songbirds...)
(And we'll keep you!)

Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you
Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you!

They run deeper into the woods
They wished they could fly
In the moonlight
They saw those lurking soldiers
Creeping by

Her hunters were whispering
And humming an old tune
Like rolling, they passed those little seekers
Leaving them alone

(Hey you, little songbirds!)
(Come here, little songbirds!)
(Where are you, little songbirds?)
(Come, we'll keep you!)

(Hey you, little songbirds!)
(Come here, little songbirds!)
(Where are you, little songbirds?)
(Come, we'll keep you!)

Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you
Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you!

("Oh dear, children...
Who has brought you here?
Do come in and stay with me
No harm shall happen to you!")

Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting you
Run for your life!
She's getting closer
Run for your life!
You hear her breathing
Run for your life!
Her army's marching
Run for your life!
You feel her seeking
Reaching you, hunting all of you!
