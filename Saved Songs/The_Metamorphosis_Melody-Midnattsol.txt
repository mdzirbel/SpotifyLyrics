Listening to The Metamorphosis Melody by Midnattsol
Lyrics by genius


I know the road's full of stones
Life's not a bed of roses
Our prayers often stay unheard
But don't let it in and hurt
Even if troubles lure
You know you don't deserve
To give in
I sensed the wind whispering
You have to move on
Rejoice the moment's silent worth
And have a new birth
There is always a way
Where the rain clouds haven't left their fall
No use in digging a hole
Just focus on the goal
There is always someone
That hasn't found their soulmate yet
No point in keeping your heart numb
No doubt one day your turn will come
I know it's never too late
To change old struggling patterns
Your will is stronger than anyone's faith
So don't let them get you down
It's in you
You just haven't found
Listen to your inner voice
And arise from the ground
I heard the owl's howling
Just fly from the earth
Rejoice the moment's silent worth
And have a new birth
There is always a way
Where the rainclouds
Haven't left their fall
No use in digging a hole
Just focus on the goal
There is always someone
That hasn't found their soulmate yet
No point in keeping your heart numb
No doubt one day your turn will come
