Listening to Enter the Cipher by Follow The Cipher
Lyrics by azlyrics


I'm waking up in the middle of the night
With a feeling that something's near
Getting up to ignite the light
When my eyes is getting caught by the mirror

I can no longer see my own reflection
I can no longer breathe the air I need
There is a man instead of me inside the mirror
He's inviting me to come with him

I turn around and close my eyes
Hoping everything is an illusion
Then I hear a voice so warm and wise:
"Don't be afraid, you got a gift, my child"

Come here with me
I'll show you my dream

Suddenly I find myself in action
Walking straight to the light

Let's run away, run away
Into the world of the cipher
Just close your eyes and hold on

So run away, run away
Soon you will feel much lighter
And all your cries will be gone, will be gone

I am walking in this world of madness
Where everything looks so odd and weird
Hearing whispers telling me: "You better hurry"
Cause in this place you can't escape your fears

Stay close to me
Or you'll disappear

I'm not awake and I must be dreaming
But I feel so alive

Let's run away, run away
Into the world of the cipher
Just close your eyes and hold on

So run away, run away
Soon you will feel much lighter
And all your cries will be gone, will be gone

Am I lost, am I gone forever in this illusion
I'm not afraid cause I must be dreaming
But I feel so alive

Let's run away, run away
Run away, run away

Let's run away, run away
Into the world of the cipher
Just close your eyes and hold on

So run away, run away
Soon you will feel much lighter
And all your cries will be gone, will be gone

Will be gone
