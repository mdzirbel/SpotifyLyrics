Lyrics by azlyrics


Country in depression
Nation in despair
One man seeking reasons everywhere
Growing hate and anger
The Fuhrer's orders were precise
Who was to be blamed and pay the price!

Wicked propaganda
Turning neighbors into foes
Soldiers of the third Reich searching homes
And then the former friends are watching
As they are rounded up one by one
Times of prosecutions has begun

Ever since it started
On Crystal night of 38
When liberty died
And truth was denied
Sent away on train sent on a one way trip to hell
Enter the gates Auschwitz awaits!

When freedom burns
The final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn
The curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

There was a country in depression
There was a nation in despair
One man finding reasons everywhere
Then there was raising hate and anger
The Fuhrer's orders still apply
Who was to be blamed and send to die!

[3x chorus]
