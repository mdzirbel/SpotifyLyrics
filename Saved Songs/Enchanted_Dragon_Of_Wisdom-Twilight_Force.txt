Listening to Enchanted Dragon Of Wisdom by Twilight Force
Lyrics by genius


A new dawn is rising again
His glory will shine forever
Spreading the wings in his den
With power he takes to the sky
With fire he roars 'cross the plain
His legend will live forever
The kingdom below is his reign
The spirit will never die

Born in ancient times of tyranny
Magic powers summon wings of steel
Eternal fire lights our destiny
Magic spells of fire broke the seal

We will stand by his side
Magic wings we will ride
Like a mighty flame
Over forest and hills
Thunder strikes when he flies
There is lightning in his eyes
The enchanted dragon of wisdom

He came to our land long ago
He told us to fight forever
His powerful words in our mind
Commanding us to be brave
In darkness and times of despair
We'll be his knights forever
There is no need for prayer
He'll stay here once and for all

Born in ancient times of tyranny
Magic powers summon wings of steel
Eternal fire lights our destiny
Magic spells of fire broke the seal

We will stand by his side
Magic wings we will ride
Like a mighty flame
Over forest and hills
Thunder strikes when he flies
There is lightning in his eyes
The enchanted dragon of wisdom
