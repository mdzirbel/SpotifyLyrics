Listening to Come with Me to the Other Side by Orden Ogan
Lyrics by genius


Come with me to the other side - Leave the pain of this world behind
For whatever you will decide - You're wrong… I'll be your bonfire

Come with me to the other side
Leave the pain of this world behind
For whatever you will decide - You're wrong

I can see my grin in the reflection of the blade and feel confidence
And joy 'cause the decision now is made
The steel is cold and brings a stream over my skin, open up this
Empty shell and free the icebound soul within …Why don't you…

Come with me to the other side
Leave the pain of this world behind
For whatever you will decide - You're wrong

Come with me I will guide the way your whole life led to this day
Come with me let me be your light
Just you and me and the eternal night - Why don't you…

Come with me to the other side
Leave the pain of this world behind
For whatever you will decide - You're wrong

I'll be your bonfire
Come with me to the other side
Leave the pain of this world behind
