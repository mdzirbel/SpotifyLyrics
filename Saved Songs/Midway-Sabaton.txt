Listening to Midway by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


Send them over the waves
Our sentinels
They report in the news
Position of our foes

This battlefield's been chosen, tactically in advance
Time to alert our fighters
We're soon in range

Midway
We'll meet at Midway
Naval War

Calling all men to deck
Got to be airborne
Head out into the sun
Decending on our foes

This is the crucial moment, in the heat of the war
To fly and hit our targets
Down in the waves

Midway
Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war
We'll meet at Midway
To win the fight, tactics are crucial, naval war

Far from shore, a pacific war
bombs are falling from the skies
Its a bombrun day, it the naval way
A bloodred sun is on the rise
