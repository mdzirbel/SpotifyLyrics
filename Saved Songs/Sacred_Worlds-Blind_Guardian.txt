Listening to Sacred Worlds by Blind Guardian
Lyrics by azlyrics


The realm's bleeding
it suffers -
Old an weak

No further arguing
There is war at hand
The system's failing
Engine's running

Then after all
I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth

I know I will not fail
There'll be

War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Coming home

You chase in twilight
and you know
you will be on your own
on your own

The misery shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end

I'm bleeding. I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
"All dead and gone
it's out of hand
Life is in motion"
I'm wishing. I'm fading
"Time to wake up
face the truth"

I'm sinking
I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
"Time to reveal now"
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me, I will rise
Time to reveal now

I know I will not fail
Anymore

I'm the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Yesterday's gone
There's no today, no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed

There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone

And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine
My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
and feel the unholy stream

The source of my power
T-energy
I'm in control

I will live forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

I spread my wings
But keep on falling
I should have known
I can see it coming
The war is over
There's whispering in the wind
Just let me out of here
There is no way
There's no end
While all the suffering goes on
All that I know
Is that I'm not insane
It's not over
