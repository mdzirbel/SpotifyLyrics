Listening to New Dawn by Visions of Atlantis
Lyrics by azlyrics


Nights before
I thought about all the days we made it out
But today I face tomorrow
Yes there's bigger fear than before
And lonely knights are getting more
But there won't be lies and sorrow

Again I have been told to let you go
Oh no
I am sorry, cause my head won't so

Burn my heart
Burn it out
Cause without you there's no doubt
That I won't need all those feelings for a new dawn
Take my soul
Carry down all those memories to your ground
But the water in your eyes says
Forever we are bound

Blackened times I hoped in pain
But all attempts where in vain
That you would change your destination
No there are no feelings left
Little needles bigger shaft
In my head just my fixation

Again I have been told to let you go
Oh no
But otherwise my blood would stop to flow

Burn my heart
Burn it out
Cause without you there's no doubt
That I won't need all those feelings for a new dawn
Take my soul
Carry down all those memories to your ground
But the water in your eyes says
Forever we are bound
