Listening to My Land by Sonata Arctica
Lyrics by azlyrics


My own land has closed its gates on me
All alone in world, it's scaring me

I am here to prove you wrong
I'm accused to something I live for

In my dreamland, there's one who understands
A friendly soul, trusting life in your hand

Yes, I gave it all I can
Now it's invaded by a stranger

Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own

My old land is but a pile of sand
Cold and bare but something still is there

Yes, I gave it all I can
Now it's invaded by a stranger

Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave
Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own

I'm a (true) patriot, you are my land,
you have my soul, you have all I had
Now I am here, and I want it back

In my dreams, I climb the hills I see
and let a gentle breeze lead me to
plains I once have seen and
Clear blue sky, I swim in lakes I find
I build a house right there
that you can't take, never take away

I am here to claim my land
you can't keep me away, forever

Keep in mind what you have heard today
You might find that you are not so brave

Are you man enough, carrying the load all alone
When others have your own [2 times]
