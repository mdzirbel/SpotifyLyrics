Listening to Uprising by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


Warsaw Rise!

Do you remember when, when the Nazis forced their rule on Poland 1939 and the allies turned away
From the underground rose a hope of freedom as a whisper
City in despair, but they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
they were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawo, walcz!'

Spirit soul and heart
in accordance with the old traditions
1944 still the allies turn away
Fighting street to street
in a time of hope and desperation
Did it on their own and they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
they were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawo, walcz!'

[Solo – Oskar &amp; Rikard]

[2x]
All the streetlights in the city
broken many years ago
Break the curfew, hide in sewers
Warsaw it's time to rise now

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawa, walcz!'
