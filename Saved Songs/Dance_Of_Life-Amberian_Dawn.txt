Listening to Dance Of Life by Amberian Dawn
Lyrics by genius


Wind takes its place and invites
People to dance till midnight
Stomp thy feet
And let thy spirits rise with thee

Bow to the soul beside you
Swing to your right—I follow
Dust goes round in old land
And our spirits fly

I'll dance with you through your darkest nights
I will follow you
I'll dance to the beat of wounded heroes
The tune leads through the ages
Teaching the stories of the magical night
Seizing times and straying minds

Heaven and earth together
Dance of lives forever
Women glow in moonlight
Men are singing free

Swing to your left, go center
Bow to your right and gather
Circle is made and glowing
Cheering joyful sound

I'll dance with you through your darkest nights
I will follow you
I'll dance to the beat of wounded heroes
The tune leads through the ages
Teaching the stories of the magical night
Seizing times and straying minds

(solos)
I'll dance with you through your darkest nights
I will follow you
I'll dance to the beat of wounded heroes
The tune leads through the ages
Teaching the stories of the magical night
Seizing times and straying minds
