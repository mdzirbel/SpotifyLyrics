Listening to Battle of Arcane Might by Twilight Force
Lyrics by genius


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Fields on fire
Flames in the sky
Raging furious battlefield
And across the mountains
And across the valleys
Wailing cries of fear

[Pre-Chorus]
Mages hearken the call
Arcane might will prevail
Journey through the astral plains
To aid

[Chorus]
For the fallen ones
We will ride into the sky
Riding over the rainbow's light
For the flames of magic
We will rise again
In the battle of arcane might

[Verse 2]
Lightning bolts
Shoot across the skies
Storms of magic
Powerwinds
And the hordes of unlight
Dying by the hands of twilight
The kingdom was saved again

[Pre-Chorus]
Shadows conquered and gone
Arcane might has prevailed
Magic hope and glory has returned

[Chorus]
For the fallen ones
We will ride into the sky
Riding over the rainbow's light
For the flames of magic
We will rise again
In the battle of arcane might

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
For the fallen ones
We will ride into the sky
Riding over the rainbow's light
For the flames of magic
We will rise again
In the battle of arcane might

For the fallen ones
We will ride into the sky
Riding over the rainbow's light
For the flames of magic
We will rise again
In the battle of arcane might
