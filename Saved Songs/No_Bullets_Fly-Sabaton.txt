Listening to No Bullets Fly by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


From down below an enemy spotted
So hurry up rearm and refuel
But through the bomber's damaged airframe
See wounded men scared to the bone

Look to the right and then look again
And see the enemy in the eye
No bullets fly spared by his mercy
Escorted out
Out of harms way

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, Heroes, Foes

Killing machine
Honour in the sky
B-17 flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the cross he deserved

He risked his life two times that day
To save an unknown enemy
Escort to safety out of the kill zone
A short salute then departed

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, Heroes, Foes

Killing machine
Honour in the sky
B-17 flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the cross he deserved

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, Heroes, Foes

Killing machine
Honour in the sky
B-17 flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the cross he deserved
