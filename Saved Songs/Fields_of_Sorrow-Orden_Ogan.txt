Listening to Fields of Sorrow by Orden Ogan
Lyrics by genius


Grains of sand weak and blood stained
We are, we are
Trying to find our way down through the
Bottomless hourglass
The board is down, pieces set
We are, we are
Pawns trying to reach the eighth rank
Sacrificed for the Kings and Queens

On fields of sorrow, I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow, I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

We are, we are
Wild roses in the wasteland
We are, we are
Defying the desert Sun yet
Thrown into the grave at last
Memories from another era
Is what we'll be
Your grace and gentle nature
Long forgotten in the end

On fields of sorrow, I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow, I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

On fields of sorrow, the soil wants blood and tears
On fields of sorrow, these minutes feel like years
Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me in the kingdom of the dead

On fields of sorrow, I lost the love of my life
I'm standing right here where she left
On fields of sorrow, I dug a grave for my wife
I'm standing right here where I put her down to rest

On fields of sorrow, the soil wants blood and tears
On fields of sorrow, these minutes feel like years
Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me in the kingdom of the dead
Will you remember what little time we had
Will you still love me when I'm dead
