Listening to Coat Of Arms by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


At dawn envoy arrives
Morning of October 28th
"No day" proven by deed
Descendants of Sparta,
Athens and Crete!

Look north, ready to fight
Enemies charge from the hills
To arms! Facing defeat!
There's no surrender! There's no retreat!

Time after time
Force their enemies back to the line
Call to arms banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Air raid pounding the land
Bombers are flying both day and night
Endure six days of rain
Dropped by invaders bomb raid in vain

Strike hard, the tables have turned
Drive them back over the hills
At arms! Just like before
Soldiers, civilians, Hellas at war

By their own hand
Forced the enemy out of their land

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Just like their ancestors ages ago
Fought in the face of defeat
Those three hundred men
Left a pride to uphold
Freedom of death in effect

Then, now again
Blood of heroes saving their land

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas
