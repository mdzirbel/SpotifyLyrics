Listening to The Last Battle by Sabaton
Listening to The Last Battle by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


5th of May, V day is just around the corner
1945 the Führer's reign is at its end
Jenny at the gates, as the SS open fire
There's no time to waste, the final battle's begun

After the downfall, a castle besieged
Facing the Nazis awaiting relief
Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free

And it's the end of the line of the final journey
Enemies leaving the past
And it's American troops and the German army
Joining together at last

One last fight, it's the death throes of the 3rd Reich
Justice shall be done, the final battle remains
Ammo's running low, they're depleting their machine guns
Every bullet counts until surrender's announced

After the downfall, a castle relieved
Defeating the Nazis who held them besieged
Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free

And it's the end of the line of the final journey
Enemies leaving the past
And it's American troops and the German army
Joining together at last

From the foot of the Alps to the shores of the sea
From the foot of the Alps to the shores of the sea
From the home of the brave, from the land of the free
From the foot of the Alps to the shores of the sea

And it's the end of the line of the final journey
Enemies leaving the past
And it's American troops and the German army
Joining together at last
[x2]
