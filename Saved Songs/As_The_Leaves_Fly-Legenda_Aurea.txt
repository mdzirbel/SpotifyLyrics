Listening to As The Leaves Fly by Legenda Aurea
Lyrics by genius


Predicting the cold
Each tree desolates his dress
Abandoned in eternal winter
Our endeavours have lost all sense
Finally the last one has given up
There's no one left to trust
What human kind ever created
Will never be forgiven
As the leaves fly through the forest
Carried by the cold autumn's wind
Fighting helpless for deliverance
We all must confess
That death's the only release
Slowly the last man's numbed
Predicting a new beginning of all
Let they all know for all times
That no one ever stops the time
As the leaves fly through the forest
Carried by the cold autumn's wind
Fighting helpless for deliverance
We all must confess
That death's the only release
