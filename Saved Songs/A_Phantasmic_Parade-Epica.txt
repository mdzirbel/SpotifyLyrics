Listening to A Phantasmic Parade by Epica
Lyrics by azlyrics


Playing a million pictures in my mind
That travel at the speed of light
Been living in a world turned inside out
Diving through a sea that is profound

Gracing the code above and tasting life
We will obtains deciphered signs
Believing worlds below that crushed mankind
Breaking ground within the great design

Do not try to defy creation
See the world through the looking glass
Within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
You may find you’re hallucinating
If reality is defied
I can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon
This time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade

It is a choice that is my own to make
A free will to risk a leap of faith
Is it my outcome that will survive?
Finding out my life has been a lie

Do not try to defy creation
See the world through the looking glass
Within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
You may find you’re hallucinating
If reality is defied
I can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon
This time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade

Make believers
Your divine machinery
Not believing
This will seal the deal
Seize the liar
Selling hollow prophecies
Burn the hounds alive
You can watch the world bow down to you

Do not try to defy creation
See the world through the looking glass
Within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
You may find you’re hallucinating
If reality is defied
I can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon

Do not try to defy creation
See the world through the looking glass
(I live to not let go)
You may find you’re hallucinating, If reality is defied
(Behold the vertigo)
I won’t let go
This time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade
Abandon fear give in before your mind can never escape
