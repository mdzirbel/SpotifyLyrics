Listening to The Last Crusade by Epica
Lyrics by genius


Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis
Usque ad finem erit dierum

Ad finem temporum

You can't force yourself upon me
And you never will
You can't keep digging in
Desecrated graves

No more innocence left to spill

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade

Ad finem temporum

You can't get away with your crimes
And you never will
For you'll have to pay the price
And the time is near

No more innocence left to kill

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade

Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis
Usque ad finem erit dierum

Ad finem temporum

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade

Don't be afraid, participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me, I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade

Get ready to taste the
Final victory

Ad finem temporum
