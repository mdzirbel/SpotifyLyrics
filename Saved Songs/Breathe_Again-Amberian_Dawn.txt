Listening to Breathe Again by Amberian Dawn
Lyrics by genius


Black is the sky, my mind waiting for falling into the sea
Questioning why all the time of my being I'm drowning so deep

Can't I see where I'm going to?
Am I trying to pretend?
Can't see what I am going through?
Am I reaching the final end?

I wanna see where I'm arriving
Now that I'm not breathing breathing
I wanna have a choice for another feeling
When I am over the bleeding

Don't think of me as a sound of an angel just hear my voice
They're gonna find me on the edge of danger making my choice

Can't I see where I'm going to?
Am I trying to pretend?
Can't see what I am going through?
Am I reaching the final end?

I wanna see where I'm arriving
Now that I'm not breathing breathing
I wanna have a choice for another feeling
When I am over the bleeding

I can't get up
I stumble the hardest way
I can't get up
The darkness comes my way
I can't give up
I feel like I'm paralyzed
I can't give up
All my being in this world is vanishing, fading

Hell is nearing me
Please try to help me
Kiss me, kill me
I beg you to save me

Hell is nearing me
Please try to help me
Hear me, heal me
I beg for you, save me

Breathing again by the touch of an angel hearing my voice
I live again staying out of the danger making my choice

Can't I see where I'm going to?
Am I trying to pretend?
Can't see what I am going through?
Am I reaching the final end?

I wanna see where I'm arriving
Now that I'm not breathing breathing
I wanna have a choice for another feeling
When I am over the bleeding
