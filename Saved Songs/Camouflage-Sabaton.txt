Listening to Camouflage by Sabaton
Lyrics by azlyrics


I was a P.F.C. on a search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
It was the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait."
"If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge"
I said, "Well, thanks a lot!" I told him my name and asked him his

And he said "The boys just call me Camouflage"

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

Well, we fought all night, side by side, we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
And it was near the riverbank when the ambush came
And I thought it was the end, and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big Marine, he just swat it with his hand

Just like it was a fly...

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

When he led me outta danger I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then he was gone
And when I got back to my H.Q., I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big Marine named Camouflage
When I said his name, a soldier gulped, and a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said "You may be tellin' the truth, boy, but this here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed away last night
But before he went, he said Semper Fi, and said his only wish
Was to save a young Marine caught in a mirage

"So here, take his dog tag, son, I know he'd want you to have it now"

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine
