Listening to Valkyria by Follow The Cipher
Lyrics by azlyrics


This is our final resolution
We rise and unfold revolution
Valkyria is flying through the skies
She's soaking the last of your dying breath

They lie in the battlefield bleeding
They fall as we conquer and stand tall
Behold every star of the universe
Their light will be shining upon us

Once and for all we're the army fighting
Soldiers of war, we will strike with lightning
Brothers in arms, we are legion, we are one

Those who oppose will be forced to heaven
When we awake our storm will face them
Conquering the seas of the oceans seven

Constructing the world of tomorrow
Our reign is divine and you follow us
Valkyria is burning in the skies
No man can be hiding from our sight

This way we are not the forsaken
We are just alive

Our storm is emerging into the night
We dive into battle and into our fight

Once and for all we're the army fighting
Soldiers of war, we will strike with lightning
Brothers in arms, we are legion, we are one

Those who oppose will be forced to heaven
When we awake our storm will face them
Conquering the seas of the oceans seven

Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
Once and for all
