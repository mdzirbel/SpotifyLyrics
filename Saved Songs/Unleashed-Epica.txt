Listening to Unleashed by Epica
Lyrics by azlyrics


Declining, all color fading
Defining, time coming for me
Rescinding, my inspiration
Receding consciousness

Back in the day, I can recall that,
My thoughts were unclouded and sage
There was no black staining the walls of my memories
Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back, locking me cold in disparity

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

Color declines, all that defines me
Is falling away, far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time, the here and now

Where am I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Yearning again only to be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

Time is just a concept
And always the first thing to fade
Agony and weakness
Nothing we can never evade
Years are cruel, they break us
Bringing on decay and despair
Awareness and perception
Something we can never repair

Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no more losing
Save me, near me, help me, hear me
No more heartache, no misery
Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no agony
Save me, near me, help me, hear me
No more heartache, no despairing (We despair)
Cure me, free me, help me, see me
No more worry, no repairing (No repair)

Freedom for me is all I'm really wanting, needing
Give me power to break out
I can't hold on for any longer
My time has come to end it all

No one to blame, fate's only random
It's nothing we'll ever explain
So it remains

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself
Free

When will I be unleashed?
It's not the way it should be
Yearning again only to be myself
When I'm free

Unleash my consciousness

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free
