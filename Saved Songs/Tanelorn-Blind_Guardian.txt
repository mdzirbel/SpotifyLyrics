Listening to Tanelorn by Blind Guardian
Lyrics by azlyrics


I travel a dusty old road
And carry on in ultimate terror
The torture will grow
While infinity's lost
The lunatic fears the unknown

Into the fire
Curse me
Unknown
Into the fire
Everything is gone

Did I miss the point
Or fail to see
That I am lost
Cause I am chosen

Crush another tower
Grind the universe
I'll fear it into pieces
Mourn forevermore
And here I

Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

My locked up asylum
Don't turn your back
On your prodigal son
When terror is raging
Still my hate will grow

Here on my own
I've built a pyre
Oh, fire
Here on my own
I've wasted life
So weak

A dark sword
A black soul
My soulmate gets near
Deceiver
Deceiver

I'm banned from the island
Refuse my, deny me
I'm pale and I'm weak
Now I don't belong here anymore

Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

The trouble of many I've seen
It's coming to an end
Here's my last stand
The torture at last
Will be gone with the past
Infinity. Where will I go?

Into the fire
Curse me
In war
Into the fire
Everything is gone

It's your blood I desire
The last soul I require
Right alter all the damage will down

And here I
Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
"Feeding my void
Feeding my void
Here at the edge. I claim your soul"
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

Stormbringer
All hail stormbringer
