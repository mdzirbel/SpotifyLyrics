Listening to My Soldier by Follow The Cipher
Lyrics by azlyrics


Stay here with me
I need you here
The cold in me
Feeds the trembling
And it's hard to breathe in
This pain I feel within
Has gone too deep
Into my heart and soul
My self-control
Has played out its role

It's no illusion
My heart still beats your name

Hold me in your arms
Let your love unfold me
'Cause I'm falling into the storm
Where I'm alone

Your melody still comforts me
Like a remedy
And sometimes I feel
A presence so near
And then just you're here with me

I try to set you free
And I believe
I've started to heal
Then you appear just to hold me for real

It's no illusion
My heart still screams your name

Hold me in your arms
Let your love unfold me
And the stars will begin
To write our story
Be my brave, be my soldier
Save me
'Cause I'm falling into the storm
Where I'm alone

It's no illusion
My heart still screams your name

Hold me in your arms
Let your love unfold me
And the stars will begin
To write our story
Be my brave, be my soldier
Save me
'Cause I'm falling into the storm
Where I am all alone
